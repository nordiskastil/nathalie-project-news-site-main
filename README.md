- Brief description of the assignment:
The assignment was to make a news website using CSS Grid and Flexbox. It had to be a responsive design with the following views: Desktop 4 columns, tablet 2 columns, mobile 1 column. 

- How you approached the task, what tools and techniques you used, and how you planned it
I started with a sketch of the page and the division into blocks. Then I put together a menu. And added some pictures to the assets map. I linked the HTML document to style.css and added a meta tag f√∂r responsivenes. I added two special fonts via a Google font link as wel as font-awesome for icons.
- What would be next?
I would have liked to play around with the styling a bit more and make it more interactive.
